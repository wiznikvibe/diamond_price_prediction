## About the Project

Diamonds come in various shapes, sizes, and qualities, influencing their market value. This project employs machine learning algorithms to predict diamond prices, allowing users to estimate the cost of a diamond based on its characteristics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Dependencies (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/wiznikvibe/diamond_price_prediction.git]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information about various diamonds, including carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and price. The dataset is available in the [data](/data) directory.



## Usage

To use the model for predictions, refer to [notebooks/Exploration.ipynb](notebooks/Exploration.ipynb). This notebook provides a guide on how to load the model and make predictions on new data.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes.
