## About the Project

Diamonds come in various shapes, sizes, and qualities, influencing their market value. This project employs machine learning algorithms to predict diamond prices, allowing users to estimate the cost of a diamond based on its characteristics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Dependencies (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diamond-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information about various diamonds, including carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and price. The dataset is available in the [data](/data) directory.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the dataset using Jupyter Notebooks to gain insights into the features and relationships. The EDA process is documented in [notebooks/EDA.ipynb](notebooks/EDA.ipynb).

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using the processed data. The training process and model selection are documented in [notebooks/Model_Training.ipynb](notebooks/Model_Training.ipynb).

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The evaluation results are discussed in [notebooks/Evaluation.ipynb](notebooks/Evaluation.ipynb).

## Deployment

For deployment, consider using cloud platforms or frameworks suitable for your requirements. This project does not include specific deployment scripts.

## Usage

To use the model for predictions, refer to [notebooks/Exploration.ipynb](notebooks/Exploration.ipynb). This notebook provides a guide on how to load the model and make predictions on new data.
